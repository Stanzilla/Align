# Align
## Personal fork of Align


## Very simple and light addon that creates a grid on your screen to aid you in aligning and centering your UI.

Toggle: `/align`

To change the grid size, type the number after the slash command: `/align 64`
It rounds to the next multiple of 32 and will stop at 256.

Enjoy!

Huge thanks to Tuller, Nymbia, Neronix, Antiarc and Haste for their help and code!

Finally bringing this over to the Curse side of things. Enjoy!
